# Install

1. Download Sencha and put it somewhere the webserver can access it.
   This is how we serve the Sencha files for CSS, images, and JavaScript.
   For example, we put it at http://sixarm.com/extjs/

2. Clone this repo and edit the file index.html so it loads Sencha's files:
   edit the HTML stylesheet href and the script src for the ext-debug file.
  
3. Use your browser to open the index.html file as an http link, not as a local file.
   This loads index.html, which loads Sencha, which runs the demo.
