This is the same license as Sencha's open source license.

The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind,
express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of

In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any

This license is for the included software that is created by SixArm;
some of the included software may have its own licenses, copyrights,
